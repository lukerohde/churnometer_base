For the union to grow, the number of paying members has to grow, as these are the only members that fund union activity.  Other union members on service agreement are not counted.  Gratis members such as students and those on waivers are not counted.  Members in an arrears cycle are not counted unless they pay by invoice.  Invoiced members in arrears will be counted until they are sent to the debt collector.

If the number of new non-paying applications is growing, this indicates a problem with admin and applications not being processed.  It is also worth nothing, a certain percentage of new applications may be consistently exited before payment is started.  This may need to be factored when setting recruitment targets.  NB if an application is processed and payment recieved on the same day, then it won't be counted in new applications.  This member will go straight to being counted as a new paying member.

column_descriptions:
  paying_start_count: The number of members who had made at least one payment and had no problem with their payment at the start of the period.
  paying_end_count: The number of members who had made at least one payment and had no problem with their payment at the end of the period.  '{paying_end_count}' is equal to '{paying_start_count}' plus '{paying_real_gain}' minus '{paying_real_loss}' plus '{paying_other_gain}' minus '{paying_other_loss}'.
  paying_real_gain: The number of members who made their first payment or rectified a payment problem during the period
  paying_real_loss: The number of members who left the union or were found to have a problem with their payment during the period
  paying_real_net: The net change in the number of paying members during period
  income_net: The amount of money posted against members during the period (goes by data entry date with regard to the period the remittance was for).
  contributors: The number of unique members to have contributed dues during the period.
  running_paying_net: The running total of '{paying_real_net}'.  Be careful to sort by the row header then '{period_header}' (the default sort) otherwise this column won't make sense.
  period_header: The intervals dividing '{start_date}' and '{end_date}' as selected by the user.  Beware that if '{start_date}' or '{end_date}' don't align to standard interval boundaries, the first or last interval will be shorter in duration.
  paying_other_gain: The number of paying members transferred to the {group_by} during the period without affecting the union's bottom line.  e.g. transfers of sites between organisers.
  paying_other_loss: The number of paying members transferred out of the {group_by} during the period without affecting the union's bottom line.  e.g. transfers of sites between organisers.
  a1p_start_count: The number of members who, prior to the start of the period, hadn't made their first payment since a the union an application (as indicated by datecreated)

  a1p_real_gain: The number of people for whom we processed a new application (as indicated by datecreate) during the period (without paying us the same day).  Most of these are new joiners (see '{a1p_newjoin}') but some may have already been members (see '{a1p_rejoin}').  NB Some member have their datecreated set when they are un-resigned in order to make a last payment - these people are excluded if datecreated is within 21 days of date exited.
  a1p_to_other: The number of members with an application pending payment who exited during the period 
  a1p_newjoin: The number of applications received during the period, from people who had not been a member before
  a1p_rejoin: The number of applications received during the period, from people who had been a member before
  a1p_to_paying: The number of members with a new application who started paying during the period.
