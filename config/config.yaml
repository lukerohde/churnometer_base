column_descriptions:
  paying_real_net: The number of members whose status became 'paying' during the period minus those that lost the 'paying' status
  paying_end_count: The number of members with the 'paying' status at the end of the period.  '{paying_end_count}' is equal to '{paying_start_count}' plus '{paying_real_gain}' minus '{paying_real_loss}' plus '{paying_other_gain}' minus '{paying_other_loss}'.
  a1p_real_gain: The number of people who became 'awaiting first payment' during the period.  Most of these are new joiners (see '{a1p_newjoin}') but some may have already been members or become 'awaiting first payment' for administrative reasons (see '{a1p_rejoin}') .
  a1p_to_other: The number of 'awaiting first payment' members who were removed from the database during the period.
  paying_start_count: The number of members with the 'paying' status at the beginning of the period.
  paying_real_gain: The number of members whose status become 'paying' during the period.
  paying_real_loss: The number of members whose status ceased to be 'paying' during the period.
  income_net: The amount of money posted against members by support staff during the period (without regard to the period the payment was remitted for).
  contributors: The number of unique members to have contributed dues during the period.
  running_paying_net: The running total of '{paying_real_net}'.  Be careful to sort by the row header then '{period_header}' (the default sort) otherwise this column won't make sense.
  period_header: The intervals dividing '{start_date}' and '{end_date}' as selected by the user.  Beware that if '{start_date}' or '{end_date}' don't align to standard interval boundaries, the first or last interval will be shorter in duration.
  paying_other_gain: The number of paying members gained without involving a member status change and without affecting the union's bottom line.  e.g. transfers of sites between organisers.
  paying_other_loss: The number of paying members lost without involving a member status change and without affecting the union's bottom line.  e.g. transfers of sites between organisers.
  a1p_start_count: The number of members with the 'awaiting first payment' status at the beginning of the period.
  a1p_end_count: The number of members with the 'awaiting first payment' status at the end of the period.
  a1p_newjoin: The number of members who became 'awaiting first payment' during the period who have never been a member before.
  a1p_rejoin: The number of members who became 'awaiting first payment' during the period who have been a member before.
  a1p_to_paying: The number of members who stopped being 'awaiting first payment' during the period because they started paying.
  a1p_other_gain: The number of 'awaiting first payment' members gained without involving a member status change and without affecting the union's bottom line.  e.g. transfers of sites between organisers.
  a1p_other_loss: The number of 'awaiting first payment' members lost without involving a member status change and without affecting the union's bottom line.  e.g. transfers of sites between organisers.
  posted: The amount of money posted to members during the period, including money reposted because of corrections (see '{unposted}').  NB corrections are applied to the period for which they money belongs in order to ensure historical consistency.
  unposted: The amount of money deducted during the period, usually because of undoing a payment.  Be aware that when an undone payment is reposted, the amount will appear in '{posted}'.
  annualisedavgcontribution: The total amount of money posted during the period, divided by the number of unique contributors, scaled to make the period equivalent to a year.  NB If, for any reason, money isn't received for a large portion of members for a large portion of the period, this figure will be low.  e.g.  Members were redistributed (think area changes) or reclassified (think industry changes) mid way through the period.
  stopped_start_count: The number of members with the stopped paying status at the start of the period.
  stopped_end_count: The number of members with the stopped paying status at the end of the period.
  stopped_real_gain: The number of members who changed to the stopped paying status during the period.
  stopped_real_loss: The number of members who changed from the stopped paying status to something else during the period.
  stopped_other_gain: The number of members with the stopped paying status who transfered into this group without changing status.
  stopped_other_loss: The number of members with the stopped paying status who transfered out of this group without changing status.
  stopped_unchanged_gain: The number of members who became stopped paying during the selected period and are still are stopped paying
  a1p_unchanged_gain: The number of members who became awaiting first payment during the selected period and are still are awaiting first payment
  stopped_to_paying: The number of 'stopped paying' members who resumed paying
  stopped_to_other: The number of 'stopped paying' members who got a new status (other than paying) probably due to some follow up process.
  transactions: The number of individual transactions that were posted against members.  A out of pay payment will usually contain numerous transactions.
  lateness: The remittance status of each employer with at least one OOP member attached. The next due date is determined from the '{paidto}' plus the average duration between payments (multipled by the number of unposted payments) plus half this average duration to allow for processing.
  paidto: The date up to which money has been posted.  The employer may have paid past this date but unposted payment don't count toward the '{paidto}' because the '{paidto}' is determined during payment posting.
  paymenttype: Code representing either out of pay, direct debit, credit card or personal (invoice)
  green_real_gain_nonmember:  New contributors are new members that should contribute i.e. new  student and other union members aren't counted.   
  green_real_gain_member: Retained contributors are members who weren't paying (in arrears, waiver etc) that should now contributor without problem.
  green_real_loss:  These losses are exited contributors and contributors going on waiver or entering arrears.
  green_end_count: Contributors at the end date (paying and new applications pending payment)
  waiver_end_count: Members at the end date who are not required to pay  
  orange_start_count: The number of members who weren't contributing at the start
  orange_start_count: The number of members who weren't contributing at the start

  running_orange_net: The cumulative net change in non-contributing members
  orange_other_gain: Non contributing members transferred in
  orange_other_loss: Non contributing members transferred out
  orange_end_count: The number of members who weren't contributing at the end

  title: Contributing members
  description: |
               This chart shows the gain and loss of contributing members for the period.

               Gains are divided between new members (green) and retained members (orange).  Retained members are those coming out of waiver or arrears.  Click the brown bar to get a combined list.  New non-contributing members, such as students, are not counted in gains until they start contributing (where they'll show as retained).

               Losses are divided into exited members (red) and those who stopped contributing (orange). Only exited members who were contributing are shown in the red because non-contributing members were already counted when they stopped their contribution.

               If a member joins and resigns multiple times they'll be counted multiple times in the green and red, likewise in the orange if a member stops and starts their contribution multiple times.  This is so the separate counts from different periods add up when those periods are combined.   The retained members are included because problem members were needed and the report can't balance without both.
